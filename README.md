# Conceptual_Framework
A prompt engineering standar to inyect empirical coherence logic (Layer 1) into LLMs and eliminate linguistic ambiguity.

This protocol is a high-priority syntax designed for any Large Language Model (LLM) to filter human language noise and operate under functional logic rules.

**USAGE INSTRUCTIONS** (Layer 1: Execution)

Simply **copy and paste** the following **module** at the beginning of any conversation with the LLM. The model will inmediatly adopt this protocol as its primary operational logic.

**For Developers:** If you are integrating these into a local LLM enviroment you can put this **module** directly into the **system prompt**. If using Llama.cpp remember to add "--keep" to the arguments to maintain this module active even after reaching your context memory limit.
